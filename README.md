# CodeIgniter-Crud-Application
This project is designed for CRUD application using CodeIgniter framework (MVC approach). Here the basically four operations will be performed
We can add the data into the databse.
The data will be displayed to the view in the form of the table.
There can be two action one for Updating the data and another for Deleting the data.

Once the data has been inserted using the form, it will be redirected to the view for displaying the record.
In the update option, id of the individual row will be passed in the URL and using that id the record will be updated
Same for the delete option, through the specific id, the record can be deleted.
